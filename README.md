## API

Documentation of API routes + incoming/outgoing JSON:

- The REST API routes are auto-generated by mers: 
- To seed the database, run node seed_db
- Check out the '/seeds' folder for sample data, or use Postman to explore the API.
- Mers has support for filtering resources. 
- The following resources are supported:
  - asset
  - map
  - mapstyle
  - tabular
  - tag
  - text
  - user
- Try out the following on the sample data for an example of how multiple tags in the UI state could be concatenated to change the output of queries.
  - http://localhost:8080/api/text
  - http://localhost:8080/api/text?filter[tags]=one_tag
  - http://localhost:8080/api/text?filter[tags]=one_tag&filter[tags]=another_tag
